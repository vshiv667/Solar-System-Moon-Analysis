# Solar-System-Moon-Analysis
Data Processing &amp; Analysis to study the characteristics of moons according to their roman numeral designation.

# Objective
Data Analysis carried out for over 200 moons across various planets in the solar system. Data imported include moon name, moon raduis and moon orbital period among others. Objective is to study the characteristics of moons according to their roman numeral designation.

# Inference
1.The Roman Numeral designations between 1-17 have the highest number of moons without retrograde motion at 35 moons.

2.The Roman Numeral designations between 18-35 have the highest number of moons with retrograde motion at 46 moons.
The Roman Numeral designations between 18-35 also has the highest number of total moons (both with & without retrograde) at 76 and highest median orbital rotation with 970.58 days.

3.The highest mean orbital rotation of 1306.05 days, is for moons with Roman numeral designations 36-53. But they also have the highest standard deviation of 1632.99 days.           This can be attributed to an outlier as seen in our box plot - a particular moon takes 9373.99 days for an orbital rotation around it's planet.

4.Another outlier is a particular moon taking 9115.91 days for an orbital rotation around it's planet.

Interestingly, both these outliers are for moons that have retrograde motion around it's respective planet. That is they orbit in a direction opposite to their planets spin.
